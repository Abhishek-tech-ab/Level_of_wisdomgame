<h1>Project introduction</h1> 
In the recent years, the games definition has changed very rapidly the 
combination of the various technologies making it worth interesting but 
somewhere the roots of knowledge has not touched the minds completely. 
Solve & Hit is a python based game as especially designed for the  children of age 
group 8-10 years. The player has to solve the maze with some question that will 
boost the knowledge of the children. 
So basically what is the game? Game is that which gives us fun , interest during 
playing the game but over game is not just about fun or interest only our game is 
based on methodology , culture and history which gives us fun, interest and 
knowledge , logical ability to mind and many more important information that we 
find or children find boring during study but with the help of this game they can 
learn about our history and culture with fun way . 
We give the name Solve & hit to our game because as we see first of all we have 
to solve the maze and its level and than a quiz appear and player have to hit the 
correct option among the all options so that’s why we choice the title name solve 
& hit for our game .

<h1>Project Description </h1>
The Solve & hit game consist of 2 modules .in which the maze game is the largest 
module having the various levels. The module incorporate some feature of the 
traditional maze game and the quiz module consist of the rich database for the 
questions, including lots of libraries , functions and many more sub modules and 
packages.

<h1>Project Modules </h1>
<b>a .Maze module:</b> It contains different  type of mazes , structure , levels that player 
have to solve  
So first of all we will discuss about maze module ,basically maze is a traditional 
game that we are playing since many more years in past , it’s a logical game that 
improves our logical ability to solve the problems or this type of typical and messy 
structures with the help of our logical and metal ability and if we are not able to  
 solve some problem in  maze game than our mind make other dictions to find 
some our way to solve the maze quickly. 
 
<b>b. Quiz module:</b> It contains question & answers related to history and culture. 
this quiz will be open and player have to answer the given pre define questions 
and reached to satisfactory score which will display after all answers .if players

will be open and if the player score will be less than our defined score than the 
score and message of start again will be display and player will have to start from 
beginning .

<h1>Technologies to be used </h1>
<b>Python Programming Language:-</b>The python programming language is being 
used here to develop the game ,with the pygame framework. 
<b>Database:-</b>CSV file/Json file is used to store the questions for the quiz. All the 
sample questions are stored in csv/json file. 

 <h1>Software Platform </h1>
